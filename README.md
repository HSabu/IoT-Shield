# IoT Shield – Lightweight Network Defense Using Raspberry Pi

**IoT Shield** is a Raspberry Pi-based cybersecurity project aimed at providing real-time network protection in small-scale, IoT-heavy environments such as smart homes, labs, or SME setups. The system combines multiple open-source tools to enforce encrypted communications, detect threats, and block malicious traffic with minimal user intervention.

> Developed as part of my final year dissertation at the University of Central Lancashire.

## Key Features

- DNS-level domain filtering
- Real-time traffic inspection and threat detection
- VPN tunneling and endpoint encryption
- Enforced domain restrictions for connected IoT devices
- Alert notifications for policy violations

> Full implementation details, scripts, and configurations are intentionally withheld to prevent misuse and protect academic originality. Please contact me directly for demonstrations or access under supervision.

## Use Case

This project addresses growing IoT-related threats by offering an affordable and scalable network defense solution that can operate independently of endpoint protection software. Designed for environments where user awareness and technical resources may be limited.

## Project Outcome

- Strengthened understanding of network-layer defense mechanisms
- Practical integration of multiple open-source tools on a single board computer (SBC)
- Created a foundation for scalable, low-footprint cybersecurity appliances
